										<h3>2021 VOTY Awards</h3>
									</header>
									<p>It is the time of year again where we will be not only voting for the Rocky Mountain Vehicles of the year 2021.

										The RMAP VOTY awards have traditionally been awarded at the Denver Auto Show (DAS) each year. Since the DAS encompasses two model years with its timing, RMAP must usually consider two model years with the following considerations:
										
										1. The intent is to identify and honor new designs and models in three major categories: car, truck, and crossovers.
										
										2. Models that are essentially holdovers from previous years are not to be considered UNLESS there is an outstanding feature (engine, technology, styling, or other) which changes that model substantially.
										
										3. Once the field in each category has been reduced to preferably three (no more than four) options, the general RMAP membership is invited to vote about 45 days prior to the DAS. Voters are requested to vote on vehicles they have driven and had the opportunity to form their own opinions.
										
										4. The final vote must be completed no less than 30 days prior to the opening of the DAS to allow for award logistics to be completed. In the event of a tie, a tie-breaking vote may be called for among the journalist members of the RMAP BoD.
										
										5. RMAP will make a presentation during the DAS in conjunction with the Colorado Auto Dealers Association charity promotion, just before the doors are opened for the charity gala.
										
										Again, thank you for helping to make the Rocky Mountain Automotive Press a great organization that strives to fulfil our Mission Statement.
										
										Craig Conover
										
										President RMAP</p>
